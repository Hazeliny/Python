Flow of a Web Request
1. When the request arrives at a Django app, the incoming request URL is compared to the list of paths in urls.py in the variable urlpatterns.
2. When there is a url match, it selects a "View" which is a bit of code that handles any database access and then produces and delivers the response to the browser.
3. The view access the database indirectly through an abstraction called a "model"
4. This is a general web pattern called "Model-View-Controller" or MVC.
